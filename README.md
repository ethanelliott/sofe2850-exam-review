  * QFT
    * No Gravity
    * computers need to solve the models
    * takes a long time to solve

    * 12 particles of matter
    * 3 forces of nature
    * Higgs
  * QM
    * 2 major limitations
      * No special relativity
      * particle number must be constant
      * Schrodeninger's wave eqn
  * Classical Mechanics
    * classical just means its not Quantum
    * Newton's Laws
    * Maxwell
    * Wave equation on a string
      * y is a function of t and x, as a solution to wave eqn
    * SR
    * GR
* EM Spectrum
  * know the different frequencies
  * it's on the eqn sheet
* Type algebra
  * data and a function are the same
  * optional `std::optional<T> = T + () = std::variant<T, nullopt>`
    * Sum Type
  * Monoids
  * Monad
    * mathematical structure
    * all monads are also functors
  * referential transparency
    * Behaves like a mathematical function
    * strictly based on arguments
    * no interactions with global state
    * no random numbers
* Models of nature
  * quantum field
    * discrete steps ie. cannot have a half particle
  * classical field
    * can have a half particle, ie. non discrete steps (continum)
  * fourier transform
    * break a wave into components
    * inner product for functions
* Vector field
  * arrow pointy things
  * all points in space have a pointy thing
  * divergence
    * moving out of something
    * field lines are being created or destroyed, and not conserved
  * curl
    * rotational field
    * spinny things
    * going around in contours
  * Gauss's Laws
    * divergent electrical field come from
    * divergent EM fields cannot exist (closed field lines)
  * Feraday's law
    * rotational electric field by changing a magnetic field
    * changing magnetic field will create an electric field (current)
    * right hand rule explains cross product
  * Gravitational field
    * behave like electric field except with mass
* core memory
  * series of questions
  * here is information, what model would you use to describe it
* You can't stop the beat, or electrons.
* There is no charge or current in a vacuum
* in a vacuum, field lines are conserved
* all fields are rotational
* Spank your electric fields to make magnetic fields
* four types of materials that form crystals
  * large band gaps: insulators (carbon)
* know the diagrams of semi conductors
* fermi level
  * energy at the top of the valance band
* huffman encoding
  * lossless encoding
* claude chan


## Short answer

* fmap on a list and fmap on an optional (Lec 6 or 8)
* CPU thermodynamics
  * info loss
    * AND gate loses information
  * energy in semi conductors
* isomorphism and bijection are the same

## long answer
* 1
  * all about info tech
  * that's all he can say
* 2
  * functors
  * diagram in lecture notes
  * lifts a function to operate on a container (fmap)
  * know what fmap does for lists and containers
  * bonus(2) if you draw diagram for monad
* 3
  * Building an antenna
  * how antenna works
* 4
  * how a speaker and microphone works
  * transducer
  * how the ear works (very generally)
    * draw a diagram!
